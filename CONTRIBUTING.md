# Watch mode for development
npm run watch
```

- Follow existing patterns and conventions
- Keep functions focused and modular
- Add comments for complex logic
- Use meaningful variable and function names

## Commit Messages

This project uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for automated versioning and changelog generation.

### Commit Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Commit Types

- **feat**: A new feature (triggers minor version bump)
- **fix**: A bug fix (triggers patch version bump)
- **perf**: A performance improvement (triggers patch version bump)
- **docs**: Documentation changes (triggers patch version bump)
- **refactor**: Code refactoring without feature changes (triggers patch version bump)
- **build**: Changes to build system or dependencies (triggers patch version bump)
- **style**: Code style changes (formatting, no functional changes)
- **test**: Adding or updating tests
- **ci**: Changes to CI configuration
- **chore**: Other changes that don't modify src or test files
- **revert**: Reverts a previous commit (triggers patch version bump)

### Breaking Changes

To trigger a major version bump, add `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the commit body or append `!` after the type:

```
feat!: redesign skill loading API

BREAKING CHANGE: The skill loading function now returns a Promise
```

### Examples

```bash
# Feature (minor version bump)
feat(loader): add support for YAML skill files

# Bug fix (patch version bump)
fix(server): handle missing skill directory gracefully

# Documentation (patch version bump)
docs(readme): update installation instructions

# Breaking change (major version bump)
feat!: change MCP protocol version to 2.0

BREAKING CHANGE: Requires MCP SDK v2.0 or higher
```

### Guidelines

- Use imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Reference issues in the footer: `Resolves #123` or `Closes #456`
- Keep subject line under 72 characters
- Separate subject from body with a blank line
- Use body to explain what and why, not how

## Project Structure

```
local-skills-mcp/
├── src/
│   ├── index.ts          # MCP server and handlers
│   ├── skill-loader.ts   # Skill loading logic
│   └── types.ts          # TypeScript type definitions
├── skills/               # Example skills
└── dist/                 # Compiled output
```

## Testing

This project has a comprehensive test suite with unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:ui

# Run tests once (CI mode)
npm run test:run

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run specific test suites
npm run test:unit          # Unit tests only
npm run test:integration   # Integration tests only
npm run test:e2e          # End-to-end tests only
```

### Writing Tests

- Add unit tests for new functions and modules
- Add integration tests for feature interactions
- Add end-to-end tests for complete user workflows
- Aim for high code coverage (95%+ target)
- Use descriptive test names that explain the scenario

### Manual Testing

For manual verification:

1. Build the project: `npm run build`
2. Configure MCP client to use your local build
3. Test skill discovery and loading
4. Verify error handling
