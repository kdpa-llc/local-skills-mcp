## What is Local Skills MCP?

A **universal** Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables **any LLM or AI agent** to access expert skills from your local filesystem. Your skills become portable, reusable prompt libraries that work across Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cline, Continue.dev, custom agents, or any MCP-compatible client.

Transform AI capabilities with structured, expert-level instructions for specialized tasks. Lazy loading preserves context—only skill names and descriptions load initially; full content loads on-demand.

## ✨ Features

- **🌐 Universal** - Works with any MCP client (Claude Code, Desktop, Cline, Continue.dev, custom agents)
- **🔄 Portable** - Write once, use across multiple AI systems and LLMs (Claude, GPT, Gemini, local models)
- **⚡ Context Efficient** - Lazy loading: only skill names/descriptions load initially (~50 tokens/skill), full content on-demand
- **🔥 Hot Reload** - All changes apply instantly (new skills, edits, deletions) without restart
- **🎯 Multi-Source** - Auto-aggregates from package built-in skills, `~/.claude/skills`, `./.claude/skills`, `./skills`, and custom paths
- **📦 Zero Config** - Works out-of-the-box with standard skill locations
- **✨ Ultra Simple** - Single tool (`get_skill`) with dynamic skill discovery

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Install

**From npm (recommended):**

```bash
npm install -g local-skills-mcp
```

**Alternative: From GitHub:**

```bash
npm install -g github:kdpa-llc/local-skills-mcp
```

**Or clone locally:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kdpa-llc/local-skills-mcp.git
cd local-skills-mcp
npm install  # The prepare script auto-builds
```

**Requirements:** Node.js 18+, any MCP-compatible client

### Configure MCP Client

Add to your MCP client configuration (e.g., `~/.config/claude-code/mcp.json`):

**If installed globally:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "local-skills": {
      "command": "local-skills-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

**If cloned locally:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "local-skills": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/local-skills-mcp/dist/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

**For Cline:** Same config in VS Code Settings → "Cline: MCP Settings"

**For other MCP clients:** Use the same command/args structure according to their MCP server setup.

The server auto-aggregates skills from multiple directories in this priority order (lowest to highest):

1. Package built-in skills (includes self-documenting usage guides)
2. `~/.claude/skills/` - Your global skills
3. `./.claude/skills/` - Project-specific skills
4. `./skills` - Default project skills
5. `$SKILLS_DIR` - Custom directory (if set)

Later directories override earlier ones, allowing you to customize built-in skills.

### Create & Use Skills

**Option 1: Ask Claude to Create Skills (Recommended)**

After installing Local Skills MCP, you can ask Claude to create skills for you:

```
You: "Create a Python expert skill that helps me write clean, idiomatic Python code"
Claude: [Creates ~/.claude/skills/python-expert/SKILL.md with appropriate content]
        ✅ Created python-expert skill! It's immediately available thanks to hot reload.
```

```
You: "Make a skill for reviewing pull requests focusing on security and best practices"
Claude: [Creates the skill with detailed PR review instructions]
        ✅ The pr-reviewer skill is ready to use right away!
```

Claude will use the built-in `skill-creator` skill to generate well-structured skills with proper YAML frontmatter, trigger keywords, and best practices.

**Option 2: Create Manually**

Create `~/.claude/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md`:

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: What this skill does and when to use it
---

You are an expert at [domain]. Your task is to [specific task].

Guidelines:

1. Be specific
2. Provide examples
3. Be helpful
```

**Using Skills:**

Request any skill in your AI client: `"Use the my-skill skill"`

The AI auto-discovers available skills and loads them on-demand. **All changes apply instantly** thanks to hot reload—no restart needed!

## 📝 SKILL.md Format

Every skill is a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: Brief description of what this skill does and when to use it
---

Your skill instructions in Markdown format...
```

**Required Fields:**

- `name` - Skill identifier (lowercase, hyphens, max 64 chars)
- `description` - Critical for skill selection (max 200 chars)

**Writing Effective Descriptions:**

Pattern: `[What it does]. Use when [trigger conditions/keywords].`

- ✅ **Good**: "Generates clear commit messages from git diffs. Use when writing commit messages or reviewing staged changes."
- ✅ **Good**: "Analyze Excel spreadsheets and create pivot tables. Use when working with .xlsx files or tabular data."
- ❌ **Poor**: "Helps with Excel files"

Claude uses language understanding to decide when to invoke skills—specific trigger keywords help Claude make better decisions.

## 🎯 Usage

**Single Tool:** `get_skill` - loads expert prompt instructions for specific tasks

**How it works:**

1. AI sees all available skills in the tool description (auto-updated)
2. When you request a skill, AI invokes `get_skill`
3. Full skill content loads with detailed instructions

**Built-in Skills:** The package includes four self-documenting skills that explain how to use Local Skills MCP, create new skills, and understand hot reload capabilities. These are available immediately after installation:
- `local-skills-mcp-usage` - Quick usage guide
- `local-skills-mcp-guide` - Comprehensive documentation
- `skill-creator` - Skill authoring best practices
- `skill-refresh-helper` - Hot reload capabilities guide

**Skill Aggregation:** Auto-aggregates from package built-in skills, `~/.claude/skills/`, `./.claude/skills/`, `./skills`, and `$SKILLS_DIR` (if set). Later directories override duplicates.

**Custom Directory:** Add via environment variable:

```json
{
  "command": "local-skills-mcp",
  "env": {
    "SKILLS_DIR": "/custom/path/to/skills"
  }
}
```

**Example Skill:**

```markdown
---
name: code-reviewer
description: Reviews code for best practices, bugs, and security. Use when reviewing PRs or analyzing code quality.
---

You are a code reviewer with expertise in software engineering best practices.

Analyze the code for:

1. Correctness and bugs
2. Best practices
3. Performance and security issues
4. Maintainability

Provide specific, actionable feedback.
```

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: What MCP clients are supported?**
A: Any MCP-compatible client: Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cline, Continue.dev, or custom agents.

**Q: How is this different from Claude's built-in skills?**
A: Works with any MCP client (not just Claude), aggregates from multiple directories, explicit invocation control, and better context efficiency via lazy loading.

**Q: Can I use existing Claude skills?**
A: Yes! Auto-aggregates from `~/.claude/skills/` along with other directories.

**Q: Do I need to restart after adding skills?**
A: No! Full hot reload is supported. All changes (new skills, content edits, deletions) apply immediately without restart. Skills are discovered dynamically on every tool list request.

**Q: How much context does this consume?**
A: Minimal! Only names/descriptions initially (~50 tokens/skill). Full content loads on-demand, preserving 95%+ of context.

**Q: Can I use multiple skill directories?**
A: Yes! Auto-aggregates from package built-in skills, `~/.claude/skills/`, `./.claude/skills/`, `./skills`, and `$SKILLS_DIR`.

**Q: What if I have duplicate skill names?**
A: Later directories override earlier ones: package built-in → `~/.claude/skills` → `./.claude/skills` → `./skills` → `$SKILLS_DIR`. This lets you customize built-in skills.

**Q: What built-in skills are included?**
A: The package includes four self-documenting skills: `local-skills-mcp-usage` (quick usage guide), `local-skills-mcp-guide` (comprehensive documentation), `skill-creator` (skill authoring guide), and `skill-refresh-helper` (hot reload capabilities guide). These are available immediately after installation.

**Q: Works with local LLMs (Ollama, LM Studio)?**
A: Yes! Works with any MCP-compatible LLM setup. Skills are structured prompts that work with any model.

**Q: Works offline?**
A: Yes! Runs entirely on local filesystem (though your LLM may need internet depending on the model).

**Q: How to create a good skill?**
A: Follow [SKILL.md format](#-skillmd-format). Use clear descriptions with trigger keywords, specific instructions, and examples.

**Q: Where can I get help?**
A: Open an [issue on GitHub][repo-issues].
