## [Unreleased]

### Added

## [0.1.0] - 2025-11-01

### 🎉 First Public Release

This is the initial public release of Local Skills MCP - a proof of concept for enabling any LLM or AI agent to utilize expert skills via the Model Context Protocol.

### Features

#### Universal LLM/Agent Support

- Works with any MCP-compatible client (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cline, Continue.dev, custom agents)
- Portable skills that work across multiple AI systems
- LLM-agnostic design (Claude, GPT, Gemini, local models, etc.)

#### Efficient Context Management

- Lazy loading: only skill names and descriptions initially visible (~50 tokens per skill)
- Full content loads on-demand, preserving 95%+ of context window
- Progressive disclosure pattern optimized for context efficiency

#### Powerful Skill Management

- Standard SKILL.md format with YAML frontmatter
- Automatic aggregation from multiple directories (~/.claude/skills, ./.claude/skills, ./skills, custom)
- Dynamic discovery: tool description updates in real-time with available skills
- Zero configuration: works out-of-the-box with standard locations
- Ultra-simple API: single `get_skill` tool with built-in discovery

#### Open Source Best Practices

- Comprehensive contribution guidelines (CONTRIBUTING.md)
- Code of Conduct (Contributor Covenant v2.0)
- Security policy and vulnerability reporting (SECURITY.md)
- Complete documentation and examples
- GitHub issue and PR templates
- MIT License

### Technical Implementation

- TypeScript with Node.js 18+
- Model Context Protocol SDK integration
- Version centralized in package.json (single source of truth)
- Intelligent caching and lazy loading
- Multi-directory skill aggregation with override support
